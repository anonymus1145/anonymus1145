## About me

I'm a results-driven software developer with a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly solutions. I have experience in full-stack development. 

As a assionate software developer with a fervent love for Vim, customisation, and unlocking the full potential of tools. I thrive on crafting elegant and efficient solutions, leveraging my background in C programming and proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, and SQL to tackle diverse projects with precision.

Specialising in React, Node.js, SQL, NoSQL, I work on web applications that deliver exceptional user experiences. A staunch advocate for Test-Driven Development (TDD), I utilise tools like Jest and Vitest to ensure the integrity and quality of my code.

I'm committed to continuous learning and staying updated on the latest tech trends. 

Let's connect and discuss how I can contribute to your projects and goals!
